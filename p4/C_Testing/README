SUMMARY:

    This is the codebase for CS354 Project 4 Testing.
    It tests two student functions (Alloc and Free) using multiple drivers.
    All drivers function by calling one or both of the student functions 
    after some initial setup. 

    There are

    -   alloc_multiple.c
    -   alloc_single.c

    -   mem_solution.c

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

-   Make sure you are on a CSL machine.

-   Copy the contents of this folder entirely to a folder containing your solution file.

-   Rename your file to "solution.c". Submissions were of the form xyz_mem_functions.c

-   Run "make setup" - this will copy the source files over correctly

-   Run "make all" - this will compile the executables correctly

-   Run "make alltests -i" - this will run the executable against all the tests and collect output
    in files named x_output.txt

-   The output files contain the output of Mem_Dump for the student method followed by Mem_Dump 
    for the solutions. These two are always separated by the string "<BREAK>\n".
    You can compare these in multiple ways:

    Python3-
    ############################
    x = open( "AS1_output.txt" )
    r = x.read()
    p = x.split("<BREAK>\n")
    p[0] == p[1]
    ############################

    Bash-
    ############################
    awk '/<BREAK>/ {p=1;next} p==1 {print}' AS1_output.txt > as1_student
    awk '{if (match($0,"<BREAK>")) exit; print}' AS1_output.txt >as1_sol
    diff as1_student as1_sol
    ############################


-   Run "make clean" after running these tests, to clear out all the test output and to start testing 
    again. If you do not run this, and test your code twice, the output files will be added to and not
    rewritten. 

TEST CASE DESCRIPTION: 

-   There are 10 test cases in total, each worth 5 points

-   There are 7 executables in total (AM, AS, FS, CL, CR, SF, D )

-   AM has 3 test cases (AM1, AM2, AM3) while AS has 2 test cases (AS1, AS2)

-   Every other executable corresponds to a single test case

-   The test case code can be found in the corresponding .c files in drivers/
    -   AS  :   alloc_single.c
    -   AM  :   alloc_multiple.c
    -   FS  :   free_single.c
    -   CL  :   coalesce_left.c
    -   CR  :   coalesce_right.c
    -   D   :   driver_free.c
    -   SF  :   stress_free.c

-   Each test case tries to either allocate or free or do both using the student methods. It 
    may use our methods also, depending on the exact test case. For example, a test case
    for Alloc (AM, AS) compares Mem_Alloc between student and ideal solution.
